Mano
====

The Mano machine is a computer theoretically described by M. Morris Mano.
It contains a central processing unit, random access memory, and an input-output bus.
Its limited instruction set and small address space limit it to use as a Microcontroller.
But it can easily be expanded to have a 32-bit accumulator register, and 28-bit addressing using a HDL language like Verilog or VHDL; And at the same time, make room for new instructions.
